\begin{abstract}
In modern business and educational environments, meetings and presentations are key means of communication, and their importance continues to grow. However, presenters and participants often experience cognitive overload as they manage speech delivery, script reference, slide transitions, and time management while also trying to follow complex discussion flows and decisions. This leads to topic drift, loss of focus, and unclear outcomes. To address these issues, this project proposes an LG display--linked real-time meeting AI prompter that extends a traditional teleprompter into an active, context-aware assistant. The system listens to participants' speech, interprets the meeting context in real time, and presents the next required information---such as agenda structure, current topic, decisions, and action items---on LG displays, while providing a private coaching dashboard for the presenter or host. Core features include real-time STT, flexible speech-to-script matching, keyword omission detection, a real-time feedback dashboard, agenda visualization, decision and action-item extraction, and fact-check widgets. A Meeting Summary Report summarizes key topics, ideas, decisions, and action items after the session. Through these functions, the project aims to improve both individual presentation quality and overall meeting efficiency, and to explore integration within LG's smart office ecosystem.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Challenges in Modern Presentations and Meetings}
In professional and academic settings, presentations and meetings have become essential tools for sharing ideas and making decisions. Yet presenters and facilitators must simultaneously handle speech delivery, script reference, slide transitions, and time tracking, while participants struggle to follow complex discussion flows and remember key points. This often causes interruptions in the presentation flow, omission of important content, topic drift during discussions, and unclear conclusions, ultimately reducing communication efficiency.

\subsection{Limitations of Existing Solutions}
Existing tools such as teleprompters, timers, and subtitle features mainly provide static information or simple transcription. They are useful for displaying text but do not actively intervene in real time to prevent topic drift or support decision alignment. Many AI-based meeting services focus on post-meeting summaries or minutes, which help review what happened but do not improve the efficiency of the meeting while it is in progress. As a result, core issues such as cognitive overload and live meeting inefficiency remain unresolved.

\subsection{Project Goals and Proposed Solution}
This project proposes an integrated support system that covers preparation, live delivery, and post-meeting feedback. The core concept is an ``LG Display--Linked Real-Time Meeting AI Prompter.'' The system continuously listens to meeting audio, analyzes the semantic context of each utterance, and surfaces what the meeting needs next: agenda structure, current topic, decisions, action items, and fact-check results. At the same time, it provides a private teleprompter and coaching dashboard for the presenter or host, helping with script tracking, omission alerts, pacing, and gesture suggestions. The ultimate goal is to reduce cognitive load and improve meeting focus and decision-making speed.

\subsection{Dual-Screen Architecture for LG Displays}
To support both individual coaching and shared awareness, the system adopts a dual-screen architecture. Screen~1 (Presenter Dashboard) is shown on the presenter's personal device (e.g., LG Gram) and provides a private teleprompter, omission alerts, pace metrics, and AI suggestions. Screen~2 (Shared Meeting Board) is shown on LG signage, LG One:Quick, or conference room TVs and visualizes slides, the real-time agenda map, decisions and action items, and fact-check widgets for all participants. This separation allows the presenter to receive rich guidance without overwhelming the audience, while participants share a clear view of where the meeting is and what has been decided.

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Before Presentation}
This phase focuses on the preparation process before a presenter begins their presentation. Users interact with the system to upload materials, create a script, and adjust content to fit the presentation environment.

\subsubsection{Slide-Script Alignment Recognition and Consulting}
When a user uploads a PPTX or PDF file, the system extracts textual and visual elements using \texttt{python-pptx} and the Google Vision API (OCR). A multimodal LLM processes these elements to interpret textual and graphical contexts, generating a coherent draft script for each slide.

\textit{Acceptance Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item OCR text recognition accuracy $\geq 95\%$.
\item Draft script grammatical accuracy $\geq 95\%$.
\item Slide--text coherence $\geq 95\%$.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Input \& Output}
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: Presentation file (.pptx, .pdf).
\item Output: Structured text/image metadata, draft script (3--6 sentences per slide).
\end{itemize}

\textit{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Max 100 slides.
\item Max file size 200~MB.
\item Max 10 images per slide.
\item Supported formats: PPTX, PDF.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Presentation Environment-Specific Script Adjustment}
The system adjusts the script's vocabulary level, tone, and length based on the audience type (non-expert / practitioner / expert), target presentation time, and speaker's pace. Using TensorFlow.js-based vision models, audience facial expressions are analyzed every 3 seconds to compute a ``focus score'' (0--100). When time is running short or audience engagement decreases, an LLM provides real-time summaries or interactive remarks.

\textit{Acceptance Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Script adjustment time $\leq 5$~s.
\item Focus detection accuracy $\geq 85\%$.
\item Timing deviation $\leq \pm 5\%$.
\item Script fluency $\geq 90\%$.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Input \& Output}
\begin{itemize}

\textit{Acceptance Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Matching success rate $\geq 90\%$.
\item False match rate $\leq 5\%$.
\item Matching latency $\leq 0.3$~s per sentence.

\textit{Acceptance Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Supplement generation time $\leq 5$~s.
\item Contextual coherence $\geq 90\%$.
\item Integration success rate $\geq 90\%$.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Input \& Output}
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: Missing sentence ID, context text, LLM API key.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Speech Gesture Suggestions}
Before the presentation, the system analyzes slide images with a multimodal LLM to detect key visual elements (graphs, photos, diagrams) and map them to related keywords. During speech, when such keywords appear in STT, gesture icons (e.g., pointing, emphasis) are displayed on the teleprompter.

\textit{Acceptance Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suggestion latency $\leq 2$~s.
\item Gesture relevance $\geq 85\%$.
\item Recognition accuracy $\geq 90\%$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Version Control System}

To manage source code and documentation, a version control system based on Git was established. A public repository named \textit{ai-assistant-for-presentation} was created on GitHub. The following source code and documents have been uploaded to the repository:
\begin{itemize}
\item All backend and frontend source code.
\item Shared documents including this file (project\_documentation.md) and other design files.
\item Configuration files and project-related assets.
\end{itemize}
All team members (development, project management, and UI/UX design) have been granted access to the repository. For efficient GitHub management, the team will adopt a branch management strategy as illustrated in the architecture diagram.

    \label{fig:placeholder}
\end{figure}

%========================
\section{Development Environment}

\subsection{Choice of Software Development Platform}

\subsubsection{Platform Selection and Rationale}
The project adopts a web-based client--server architecture as its primary development and deployment platform. The web environment ensures platform-independent accessibility without requiring users to install additional software, while providing seamless integration with cloud-based APIs such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and large-language-model (LLM) services. Modern web technologies, including WebSockets, Web Audio API, and TensorFlow.js, enable the implementation of essential real-time features such as live teleprompting and synchronized feedback dashboards.

\subsubsection{Programming Languages and Rationale}
\begin{itemize}
\item Backend: Node.js--based API Routes are used to handle REST APIs and real-time communication (e.g., WebSocket or streaming endpoints). Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven runtime that is well suited for real-time applications such as teleprompters and meeting assistants. It also enables tight integration with the React frontend and offers a rich JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem for calling external AI services (e.g., STT APIs and LLM APIs) and managing asynchronous workflows.
\item Frontend: TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js 20 or higher) with React 18.2. JavaScript is the only natively supported browser language and is indispensable for client-side interaction. React combined with TypeScript supports modular, maintainable UI components and ensures type safety.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cost Estimation}
The estimated total development cost is approximately USD~30.00, as summarized below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware: Personal laptops (MacBook Air/Pro) -- USD~0.00.
\item Software and IDE: Visual Studio Code (free), Cursor Pro (USD~20 per month).
\item Cloud Services and APIs: AWS Free Tier, GCP STT and Vision API, OpenAI GPT Realtime Mini (approx.\ USD~10).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Development Environment Details}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operating Systems: Windows~11, macOS~14 (Sonoma).
\item IDEs: Visual Studio Code (v1.90 or higher), Cursor (v1.7 or higher).
\item Version Control: Git (v2.39 or higher) and GitHub public repository (\textit{ai-assistant-for-presentation}).
\item Backend Stack: Python~3.11+, FastAPI~0.110+, PostgreSQL~16 (Render hosted).
\item Frontend Stack: Node.js~20.10+, npm~10.2+, React~18.2+, TypeScript~5.2+.
\item Major Libraries: \texttt{python-pptx}, sentence-transformers, WebSockets, TensorFlow.js, Web Audio API.
\item Hardware Resources: Three personal laptops (two MacBook Airs, one MacBook Pro) used for development and testing.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use of Commercial Cloud Platforms}
\begin{itemize}
\item Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Utilized for Speech-to-Text and Vision OCR services to enable high-accuracy transcription and slide text extraction. Services operate within free-tier quotas.
\item Amazon Web Services (AWS): EC2 for backend deployment, S3 for file storage, RDS for database hosting, and Route~53 for domain management. Free-tier services are used for prototype deployment and demonstration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software in Use}
Several existing software solutions and research studies were referenced in designing the system:
\begin{itemize}
\item PromptSmart (VoiceTrack): A commercial teleprompter offering real-time voice tracking. The proposed system extends its capabilities by adding semantic matching, omission detection, and automated slide control.
\item Microsoft PowerPoint (Live Subtitles): Provides speech transcription but lacks contextual synchronization with scripts and automated slide transitions.
\end{itemize}
These benchmarks highlight the project’s improvements in real-time adaptivity and AI-driven presentation assistance.

\subsection{Task Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Backend Development (Sangyoon Kwon, Dohoon Kim): System architecture design, FastAPI server and WebSocket implementation, database schema (PostgreSQL), AI logic integration (STT, LLM, BERT), cloud deployment (AWS, Render).
\item Frontend Development (Hyeyun Kwon, Seohyun Kim): React-based UI implementation, client-side state management, real-time dashboard (Web Audio API), teleprompter interface, client-side AI (TensorFlow.js).
\item Project Management \& UI Design (Daeun Lee, Minhyuk Jang): Project planning and scheduling, UI/UX design (Figma), documentation and VCS management, user testing and feedback analysis.
\end{itemize}

\section{Specification}

\subsection{Requirement 1: Real-Time Teleprompter}

This process involves a tightly coordinated real-time loop between the client (web browser) and the server (Python backend) through WebSocket communication.

\subsubsection{Client Initialization}
When the user presses ``Start Presentation,'' the React frontend requests microphone access using \texttt{navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()} and establishes a secure WebSocket (\texttt{wss://}) connection to the backend API server. The Web Audio API initializes an \texttt{AudioContext} and \texttt{ScriptProcessorNode} to capture raw audio chunks.

\subsubsection{Client-Side Real-Time Audio Streaming}
The \texttt{ScriptProcessorNode} continuously triggers \texttt{onaudioprocess} events (e.g., every 500~ms). Each raw audio buffer (16-bit PCM) is sent to the backend server through WebSocket.

\subsubsection{Server-Side STT and Synchronization}
The backend receives the audio chunks and streams them to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. The API returns interim (fast but less accurate) and final (slower but more accurate) transcripts. When a final sentence is received, it is appended to the full transcript of the session. The backend then calls the \texttt{FlexibleSpeechMatcher} service to locate the new \texttt{currentSentenceIndex} within the user’s script.

\subsubsection{Server Broadcast}
The server immediately sends a WebSocket message to the client:
\begin{verbatim}
{ "action": "UPDATE_TELEPROMPTER",
  "index": currentSentenceIndex }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Client Update}
The frontend WebSocket listener receives the message and updates the highlighted text accordingly, scrolling the teleprompter to the current index in real time.

\subsection{Requirement 2: Flexible Speech-to-Script Matching}
This algorithm implements a hybrid matching mechanism combining fast vector similarity and fallback large-language-model (LLM) validation.

\subsubsection*{Pseudocode Overview}
\begin{verbatim}
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.75
SEARCH_WINDOW = 5
LLM_VALIDATION_THRESHOLD = 0.60

Function FindCurrentPosition(fullTranscript,
                             scriptSentences,
                             lastIndex):

    latestTranscript = GetLastNWords(fullTranscript, 10)
    transcriptVector = 
        KoSentenceBERT.encode(latestTranscript)

    searchStart = lastIndex
    searchEnd = min(lastIndex + SEARCH_WINDOW,
                    len(scriptSentences))
    searchWindow = scriptSentences[searchStart:searchEnd]

    bestMatchIndex = -1
    highestSimilarity = 0

    # Step 1: Fast vector similarity
    for index, sentence in enumerate(searchWindow):
        similarity = CosineSimilarity(
            transcriptVector, sentence.vector)
        if similarity > highestSimilarity:
            highestSimilarity = similarity
            bestMatchIndex = searchStart + index

    # Step 2: Omission check
    if bestMatchIndex > lastIndex:
        CheckForOmissions(lastIndex, bestMatchIndex,
                          scriptSentences)

    if highestSimilarity >= SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD:
        return bestMatchIndex

    # Step 3: LLM fallback validation
    if highestSimilarity >= LLM_VALIDATION_THRESHOLD:
        prompt = CreateLLMPrompt(latestTranscript,
                                 searchWindow)
        AsyncCallLLM(prompt, HandleLLMResult)
        return bestMatchIndex

    return lastIndex
\end{verbatim}
This process ensures low latency while maintaining semantic accuracy through adaptive matching.

\subsection{Requirement 3: Key Content Omission Detection}
This function integrates directly with the flexible matching process. When a skipped section is detected, the system checks whether any omitted sentence contains a predefined key phrase and alerts the presenter.

\subsubsection{Database Preparation}
When users upload a script, each sentence is marked with a boolean attribute \texttt{isKeyPhrase} (true / false) and stored in the database.

\subsubsection{Server-Side Omission Detection}
When \texttt{FindCurrentPosition()} identifies a new \texttt{bestMatchIndex} greater than \texttt{lastIndex + 1}, the server calls \texttt{CheckForOmissions()}.

\subsubsection{Omission Logic}
If skipped sentences are found between the two indices, each is inspected for \texttt{isKeyPhrase == true}. When detected, the omitted sentence index is flagged, and the following message is broadcast:
\begin{verbatim}
{ "action": "OMISSION_DETECTED",
  "index": omittedSentenceIndex }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Client Notification}
The frontend highlights the corresponding part of the script (for example, flashing red or adding a border) to visually warn the presenter in real time. Simultaneously, an asynchronous script-reconstruction task (Requirement 4) is triggered.

\subsection{Requirement 4: Real-Time Script Reconstruction}
This asynchronous process generates short ``bridging sentences'' whenever key content omissions are detected, ensuring smooth narrative flow without latency in the main loop.

\subsubsection{Asynchronous Trigger}
\texttt{CheckForOmissions()} launches \texttt{HandleOmissionAsynchronously()} in a separate asynchronous task.

\subsubsection{Prompt Generation for LLM}
The function combines three inputs: (a) the omitted sentence, (b) the current context sentences, and (c) an instruction prompt such as:
``You are a presentation coach. The presenter accidentally omitted `[omittedSentence]' and is now moving to `[contextSentences]'. Please generate one short, natural bridging sentence in Korean that connects these topics smoothly.’’

\subsubsection{LLM API Invocation}
The backend asynchronously requests an LLM (e.g., GPT or Gemini) to generate the bridging sentence.

\subsubsection{Response Delivery}
Upon success, the server sends the message:
\begin{verbatim}
{ "action": "SCRIPT_SUGGESTION",
  "text": llm_generated_sentence }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Client Interface Behavior}
The React frontend displays the generated sentence in the AI Suggestion section as an alert message: ``Do you approve this suggestion?'' with Accept and No buttons. If the user selects Accept, the updated script is applied and a small alert ``Update complete'' appears at the top-right corner.

\section{Architecture Design}

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
The overall architecture consists of three main modules: the Frontend (React web application), the Backend (Main Server), and the Data \& AI Service layer (Supabase--PostgreSQL and Gemini). Together, these components form an end-to-end pipeline that captures the user’s speech in Chrome, processes it, and reflects the results on the presentation and meeting interfaces in real time.

The first module, the Frontend, is implemented as a React + TypeScript web application running in the Chrome browser. The user speaks through the browser, and the Web Speech API converts the voice input into text. Using this text and the data received from the backend, the frontend renders the real-time teleprompter view, the meeting agenda map, and related dashboards. It communicates with the backend via WebSocket and REST APIs, sending user input and receiving updates such as AI analysis results, alerts, and script suggestions, which are then dynamically reflected in the user interface.

The second module, the Backend (Main Server), is built on Node.js--based API Routes and serves as the core processing engine of the system. The backend aggregates utterance text and UI state from the frontend, manages them at the session level, and interprets the overall flow of presentations and meetings. It also integrates with external AI services such as Gemini and other STT/summary APIs by sending script files and meeting content and receiving various inferred results, including summaries, classifications, and suggested sentences. These results are returned to the frontend for visualization and are persisted in the database for later review and analysis. Thanks to Node.js’s non-blocking, event-driven architecture, the backend can handle real-time text streaming and notification delivery with minimal latency.

The third module is the Data \& AI Service layer. Through Supabase, the backend accesses a PostgreSQL database via REST APIs to store and retrieve user profiles, uploaded scripts, sentence-level metadata, meeting logs, and AI suggestion history. This layer ensures consistent state across sessions and provides the data foundation for both real-time operation and post-hoc analysis. On the AI side, Gemini functions as an external AI service. The backend sends script and meeting content to Gemini and receives inferred results, which are then propagated to the frontend and stored in the database, completing the overall FoS architecture.

\subsection{Module 1: Frontend}

\subsubsection*{1) Purpose}
The Frontend Module of FoS serves as the client-facing interface, allowing users to interact with the system through the web browser. It provides a seamless flow across core features such as presentation setup, real-time teleprompter, agenda tracking, and meeting summaries. The module visualizes analysis results from the server and AI modules, handles web speech input and user interactions, and aims to deliver a smooth and focused experience for presenters and meeting participants.

\subsubsection*{2) Functionality}
The frontend module manages multiple screens---including login, main dashboard, presentation setup, teleprompter, agenda map, and meeting summary---using routing to support the entire presentation and meeting flow. It forwards speech recognized by the browser's Web Speech API to the backend and, based on the returned script-matching, keyword, and agenda information, renders highlights, progress indicators, and agenda nodes in real time. It also integrates Supabase-based social login to maintain user sessions and leverages reusable components such as buttons, navigation bars, and status pills to build a consistent interface that communicates smoothly with other modules.

\subsection{Module 2: Backend \& AI}

\subsubsection*{1) Purpose}
The Backend \& AI Module acts as the core processing engine of FoS, handling requests from the frontend and executing business logic such as LLM calls, script--speech comparison, keyword extraction, and skipped-section reconstruction. Its purpose is to transform raw spoken and scripted content into structured insights, enabling intelligent features that help users stay focused on their speech during presentations and meetings.

\subsubsection*{2) Functionality}
This module exposes API endpoints under \texttt{/api} for keyword extraction, script reconstruction, LLM connectivity testing, and script--speech comparison. Using \texttt{comparison-service.ts}, it performs text normalization, partial-range search, and skipped-range detection to compute the current matched index and skipped segments, providing the data needed for teleprompter highlighting and error visualization. Through \texttt{llm-client.ts}, it encapsulates calls to LLMs such as Gemini with shared configuration, returning keyword lists, meeting-analysis JSON objects, and reconstructed sentences in a consistent format. The \texttt{types.ts} file defines shared data structures used across the module, ensuring stable and type-safe communication between APIs and other parts of the system.

\subsubsection*{3) Location of Source Code}
\url{https://github.com/april2901/fos/tree/main/api}

\subsubsection*{4) Class Component}

\paragraph{(1) \texttt{FoS/api}} 
This directory contains backend API route handlers that expose core LLM and speech-matching features to the frontend.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{extract-keywords.ts}: API endpoint that receives a presentation script, calls the Gemini model, and returns 3--5 key keywords extracted from the script.
  \item \texttt{llm-regenerate.ts}: API used to reconstruct skipped parts of a presentation script by sending the skipped content and its surrounding context to the LLM and generating a natural bridging sentence.
  \item \texttt{llm-test.ts}: Test endpoint for checking LLM connectivity and prompt/response behavior, used to verify that model calls work correctly.
  \item \texttt{speech-comparison.ts}: API that compares recognized speech text with the full script, computes the current matched index, and returns matching confidence and skipped ranges. It powers the teleprompter's highlight position and skipped-segment visualization.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{(2) \texttt{FoS/api/utils}} 
This directory contains shared business logic, utility modules, and type definitions used by the API routes.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{comparison-service.ts}: Module that implements the core logic for comparing script text and spoken text, including text normalization, partial range search, and skipped-range detection used by \texttt{speech-comparison.ts}.
  \item \texttt{llm-client.ts}: Client wrapper for calling LLM APIs (e.g., Gemini), encapsulating common configuration such as model name, temperature, token limits, and request/response handling.
  \item \texttt{types.ts}: File that defines TypeScript interfaces and types for speech comparison results, keyword extraction results, LLM responses, and other shared data structures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Module 3: Configuration}

\subsubsection*{1) Purpose}
The Configuration Module defines how FoS is recognized and deployed within the Vercel environment. It manages project metadata, linked repositories, and environment settings so that the frontend and backend modules can run consistently and reliably in the cloud.

\subsubsection*{2) Functionality}
The \texttt{.vercel} directory stores metadata such as the Vercel project ID, linked GitHub repository, and deployment environments (e.g., production and preview), controlling the deployment pipeline and domain configuration. \texttt{Project.json} defines these settings in JSON form, enabling branch-based automatic builds and deployments, while \texttt{README.txt} documents how the directory and deployment setup work so that team members can share a common understanding of the configuration and release process.

  \item \texttt{Project.json}: JSON file that stores Vercel project metadata and settings, including items such as the project ID, linked Git repository, and environment-related deployment configuration.
\end{itemize}

\section{Initial Functional Test Cases}

The system consists of six core screens, each representing a key stage in the user's presentation and meeting workflow. The overall flow begins with login, proceeds through preparation and live execution, and ends with meeting summarization.

\subsection{Screen List}

\paragraph{Screen 1. Login}
Users enter their email and password to access the system.

\paragraph{Screen 2. Main Dashboard}
Provides two primary entry points: ``Start Meeting'' $\rightarrow$ navigates directly to Screen~5 (Agenda Map), and ``Prepare for Presentation'' $\rightarrow$ navigates to Screen~3 (Presentation Preparation Screen).

\paragraph{Screen 3. Presentation Preparation Screen}
Users upload presentation slides, enter scripts, and verify estimated presentation time.

\paragraph{Screen 4. Smart Presentation Teleprompter (Presentation Mode)}
Real-time STT matches the speaker's voice to the script, highlights spoken parts, and auto-advances slides.

\paragraph{Screen 4-2. Presentation End Modal (Switch to Meeting Mode)}
After the presentation ends, users can either return to the main screen or directly begin a meeting with Agenda Map pre-generated from the presentation content.

\paragraph{Screen 5. Agenda Map (Real-Time Meeting Map)}
Real-time STT analyzes discussions, categorizes statements (Idea, Decision, Action Item, etc.), and generates a branching visual map.

\paragraph{Screen 6. Meeting Summary Report}
Displays the final agenda map, decisions, action items, and a chronological timeline of the meeting.
